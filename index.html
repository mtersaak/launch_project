        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>For our Web Development class we were given "20% time". This was where we were given time at the end of class to explore something we want and to be able to teach someone about it. The final exam is based around building the website around the Bootstrap framework. This website is about a game that I enjoy but can also teach you a thing or two. This game is called Kerbal Space Program.</p>
          <p>KSP is a game about building and launching rockets and spacecraft. This game is known for being very accurate to real life in the fact that everything in KSP is 1:10 the scale of real life. This game teaches basic rocket science, orbital mechanics, and aerospace engineering all while keeping you glued to the screen. I used Adobe Premiere Pro to edit my videos, I recorded them using Windows Game Recording on my PC and, of course, used Kerbal Space Program for footage.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h2>My name is Mark Ter-Saakyants. As I am writing this, I am in my second semester of freshman year at Glenbrook South Highschool. This page was made in my first semester of Freshman year in my Web Design and Development class. More specifically this page was made December 4th, 2018. The point of the project was to make a webpage using the Twitter Bootstrap Infrastructure.</h2>
    <h2>I chose the game Kerbal Space Program as my topic of the website because I have been playing the game for around 4 years now and have 649 hours logged into the game, and don't plan to stop anytime soon. Ever since i have been a little kid, space travel and space in general have been huge interests of mine. I believe that the reason i have such an interest in space is because my very first english book that I read all the way through, was a space book.</h2>
    <h2>This game has influenced me to research many topics regarding space travel, physics, and aerospace engineering. It also led me to finding out about a lot of revolutionary thinkers when it comes to space exploration. People such as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and his famous Delta-V equation, Segei Pavlovich Korolev and his reliable R7 workhorse rocket, which variations are still used today, and Valentin Glushko who is famous for designing the most powerful multi-combustioned chamber rocket engine ever, the RD-170.</h2>
